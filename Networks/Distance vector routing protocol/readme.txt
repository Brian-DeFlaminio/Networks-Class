Hello!

The makefile should work without issue, if somehow it doesn't
gcc project3.c node0.c node1.c node2.c node3.c -o project3

you can run the code with ./project3 #


I left the printdt# statements in there as I figured you'd need them to make grading easier. the last occurance of each table is the most updated one as they only print when they update. D3 is usually done long before the others so you might have to scroll up a bit to get it.

If there are any problems feel free to reach out!
